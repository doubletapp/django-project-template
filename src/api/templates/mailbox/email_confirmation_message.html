Congratulations, you have joined the App community.<br />
<br />
You can now go ahead and set up your profile on the app.
Please watch out for an email from your school with a unique authorization code you can use to join your school’s closed community
and to start networking.<br />
<br />
A small disclosure from our side: you are among the first few “lucky ones” to start using this beta version of our app:) 
Or to put it differently: we are still working on improving the app and we will be releasing new features on a regular basis.
Please bear with us and share your thoughts on what you like about Edge App and what can be improved 
by emailing us on help@edge-app.com (address it to Alex - he is here to help).<br />
<br />
On a more serious note, the app was born with a mission to seamlessly (re)connect students and alumni, unlocking numerous career and business
opportunities within the already existing school network. We will do our best to facilitate that.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the networking and find your edge!<br />
<br />
